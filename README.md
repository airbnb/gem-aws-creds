# AWSCreds

AWSCreds exposes your AWS credentials through a command line utility and a Ruby API.

## Why?

There is plenty to get wrong when handling credentials:

- When storing them on disk, only your user should be able to read it. awscreds will raise an exception if its permissions are too broad.
- When passing it to programs, they shouldn't be passed through the command line, or other users can find them through ps.
- When manipulating credentials in a language like Ruby, it should be as hard as possible to leak secrets through logs or traces.

Using command-line AWS tools seemed to be painful as well:

- There seemed to be no simple way to maintain a set of AWS credentials for multiple identities, and pick one quickly.
- Different tools can use different environment variables, or offer different configuration file formats.

We wanted to address this problem with:

- A simple file format and well-known location, that could be easily reimplemented;
- A simple yet flexible Ruby API, so future tools do not need to reinvent the wheel;
- A command-line utility to easily pass the credentials of your choice to command line utilities.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'awscreds'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install awscreds

## Usage

### Storage

Put your AWS credentials in `~/.awscreds`, one line per credentials, with the following colon-separated fields:

- A name for your credentials (the magic name "default" will be picked unless specified otherwise)
- The Access Key ID (20 characters, alphanumeric)
- The Secret Access Key (40 characters)

For example:

    default:AKIAIOSFODNNDEADBEEF:WT8ftNba7siVx5UOoGzJSyd82uNCZAC8LCllzcWp
    admin:AKIAIOO432MG8BADF00D:T60q14wrbyxl3Ed13VOFA/2G+nvJR/jgHC42jIH1

### Command-line utility

`awc --help` should guide you.

To list the available credentials, use `-l`:

    $ awc -li admin
     default
    *admin

To call `myscript put` and provide it with credentials, use:

    $ awc myscript put

Its effects can easily be inspected:

    $ awc -i admin env | grep AWS
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY=AKIAIOO432MG8BADF00D
    AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIOO432MG8BADF00D
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOO432MG8BADF00D
    AWS_SECRET_KEY=T60q14wrbyxl3Ed13VOFA/2G+nvJR/jgHC42jIH1
    AWSSecretKey=T60q14wrbyxl3Ed13VOFA/2G+nvJR/jgHC42jIH1
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=T60q14wrbyxl3Ed13VOFA/2G+nvJR/jgHC42jIH1

### Ruby API

The Ruby gem should be easy to use (feedback is obviously welcome).

Documentation should be improved; in the meantime, here is a simple example:

    require 'awscreds'
    require 'aws'
    creds = AWSCreds::Store.new.default_creds
    STDERR.puts "Using access key #{creds.access_key_id}"
    AWS.config creds.to_hash
